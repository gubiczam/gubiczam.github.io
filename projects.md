I made that project for kids, in a programming camp, with my friend Andr√°s. Used Python language. If you upload any picture, the program generates a txt file, wich you just copy and paste into turtleacademy, the turtle will draw the picture pixels by pixels. https://github.com/gubiczam/image_to_logo
