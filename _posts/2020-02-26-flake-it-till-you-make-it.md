My friend found himself in a digital predicament - his 1TB hard drive was drowning in a sea of 80,000 files. He yearned to clear the clutter, preserving only the cherished photos.

With Python as my trusty ally, I crafted a simple script to rescue him from the chaos. First, we categorized the files, separating the precious memories from the digital debris.

However, as we sifted through the trove of photos, we uncovered a grim truth - some were damaged or languished in unsupported formats. The memories they held were inaccessible, but my Python code wielded a scalpel, identifying these stragglers.

Files that barely weighed in at mere kilobytes or gigabytes met their end with a swift deletion. My friend's digital haven was finally in order, and he breathed a sigh of relief as his hard drive found solace in the newfound space.

In the end, technology and a little Python magic came to the rescue, allowing my friend to safeguard his cherished photos while bidding farewell to the unnecessary clutter of digital ephemera. The lesson? Sometimes, a few lines of code can bring clarity and serenity to even the most cluttered digital landscapes.
